This repository contains the code used to control and train the grippers (Two-finger and Three-Finger) currently being designed and used in the <a href="https://cares.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/">CARES lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz">The University of Auckland</a>. 
While being written for this specific system, it also intends to be applicable to many dynamixel servo systems with minor changes to the code.

## üìã Requirements

The repository was tested using Python 3.11.4 on a machine running Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS. The repository relies on [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) relying on [NVIDIA CUDA GPUs](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone). Instructions for enabling CUDA in Pytorch can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

A comprehensive list of dependencies is available in `requirements.txt`. Ensure that the hardware components for the gripper are turned on and connected to the machine.

## üë©‚Äçüè´ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository using `git clone`.

2. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the **root directory** of the package.

3. Install the two CARES libraries as instructed in [CARES Lib](https://github.com/UoA-CARES/cares_lib) and [CARES Reinforcement Learning Package](https://github.com/UoA-CARES/cares_reinforcement_learning).

4. Create a folder named `your_folder_name` to store config files. To get started, copy and paste the files in `scripts/config_examples` into the folder. For a guide on changing configs, see the [wiki](https://github.com/UoA-CARES/Gripper-Code/wiki/Configuration-Files).

## üìñ Usage

Consult the repository's [wiki](https://github.com/UoA-CARES/Gripper-Code/wiki) for a guide on how to use the package.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Setup

The current setup uses Dynamixel XL-320 servo motors (4 for Two-Finger and 9 for Three-Finger Gripper), which are being controlled using a [U2D2](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/parts/interface/u2d2/).
Below is an example of the wiring setup for the three-fingered gripper. This is easily changed for other configurations, with a maximum of 4 daisy chains coming from the U2D2.

### BOM

A list of items required to build the grippers can be found in [Grippers BOM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GFGDXZwodSCUbbnDEK6e9giJs_8Xy-eVyAdYuDRv4Qk/edit#gid=1627805202).

### STL files

3D printed parts for both grippers can be found in [Two-Finger STL](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AuBA8254ImEZFrz9au1Tdciz5qx39S2c?usp=share_link) and [Three-Finger STL](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AuBA8254ImEZFrz9au1Tdciz5qx39S2c?usp=share_link).

## üóÉÔ∏è Results

You can specify the folder to save results in using the `local_results_path` argument; otherwise, it defaults to `{home_path}/gripper_training`. The folder containing the results is named according to the following convention:

```
{date}_{robot_id}_{environment_type}_{observation_type}_{seed}_{algorithm}
```

Results are stored using the format as specified by standardised CARES RL format.
